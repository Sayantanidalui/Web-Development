    <h1>Extra-Curricular Activities :</h1>
    <h3>Painting and Drawing</h3>
    <p>Painting has been a significant Extra-Curricular activity for me as it is a wonderful way to express creativity and emotions. Each brushstroke feels like a form of meditation, helping me unwind and focus on the moment. it is not just a way to pass the time but also a journey of self-expression and exploration. It is like a therapeutic escape from daily life where I can lose myself in colors and strokes. I have partcipated in so many local competitions Where I showcased my art and received awards. This journey has not only enhanced my technical abilities but has also taught me valuable lessons in patience, focus, and self-discipline. It reflects my ability to think creatively, making me a well-rounded individual. in conclusion, painting enhances my overall personal growth, making it a vital part of my extra-curricular activites.  </p>
